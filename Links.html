The Lo-Dash on Underscore.js and Strings

What About Strings?
There isn’t any strings manipulation in Underscore, which is a big oversight in my opinion. Fortunately, 
Underscore has a great plugin system and probably the most useful Underscore.js plugin is Underscore.strings. 
With it you can truncate, trim, humanize, capitalize, prune, pad, and so much more with strings. 
You can even merge the strings plugin into the Underscore namespace like this:
_.mixin(_s.exports());
That way, your Underscore namespace has been extended with the functions from the strings plugin. 
You will magically have new functions for Underscore like this:
_.ltrim(mystring, '?')
The function “ltrim” isn’t part of Underscore.js, but actually part of Underscore.strings.
